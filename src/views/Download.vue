  <p>There are two ways to download and play Tabletop Club:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By downloading the official binary for your platform and running the executable. This is by far the simplest method, and it is all that most players need to do.</li>
    <li>By downloading the source code from the game's repository and compiling it from scratch. This requires a few extra steps compared to running a pre-built binary, but you'll need to do this if you plan on contributing to the game code, or you could try it for fun!</li>
  </ul>
